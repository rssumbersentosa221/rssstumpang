Enable large file uploads in the built-in WordPress media uploader via file chunking, and set maximum upload file size to any value based on user role.

== Description ==

**Big File Uploads lets you upload large media files directly to the media library with the WordPress media uploader. Increase your maximum upload size to any value – as large as your available disk space allows – and add file chunking to avoid server timeout errors.**

Bypass the upload limits on your server, set by your hosting provider, that prevent you from uploading large files to your media library.

Big File Uploads automatically detects upload limits set by your server or hosting provider, allows you to increase the maximum upload size, and prevents timeout errors by uploading files in chunks.

No messing with Apache/PHP initialization files or settings. Just activate the plugin, set the upload size as large as you like, and use the media uploader as you normally would.

> “This is just perfect, EXACTLY what I needed to bypass the Cloudflare upload limit. Thank you very much!!” - [shamank](https://wordpress.org/support/users/shamank/)

★★★★★
> “Excellent plugin for changing the upload size for the Media Library uploads. Even though my host allowed me a bigger upload limit (from 64MB to 200MB) I could’nt make it work. This plugin solved my problem, fast and easy. Right after the installation, I changed the size, and I was able to upload my big file. Works like a charm, thanks guys.” - [ynskalad](https://wordpress.org/support/users/ynskalad/)

### Easily Increase Maximum File Uploads

Fix “The Uploaded File Exceeds the upload_max_filesize” error that is so common when you are trying to upload big files to your WordPress media library. Set a new max file size in Big File Uploads to bypass limitations set by the server or your host.


### Set Upload Size Based on User Role

Big File Uploads lets you set a new maximum upload size limit for all uploads or customize the maximum file upload size for each of your user roles with upload capabilities. Set custom upload limits for Administrators, Editors, Authors, or even custom roles.

### Set Upload Size by File Type

Not every file needs the same limit. Turn on "Customize by file type" to give images, audio, video, documents, and archives their own maximum upload size, plus code files on sites that allow them. Fill in only the types you want to treat differently - cap images at 10 MB while still allowing 5 GB video. Any type you leave blank keeps your main upload limit. Per-type limits work alongside per-role limits - set them once for all users, or separately for each role.

### Uploads Disk Utility

The Big File Uploads plugin includes a media library disk utility that shows a breakdown of the files in your uploads directory by type and size. See how many images, videos, archives, documents, code, and other files (like audio) there are and how much space they're taking up.


### Upload Email Summary

Big File Uploads can email you a short summary of what was added to your media library. Each summary covers the last month, week, or day and shows how many files were uploaded and how much storage they added, compared with the period before, along with a breakdown by file type, the largest upload, and the totals from your last storage scan.

The summary is built and sent by your own site using the standard WordPress mail function, so by default it goes only to your site's admin email address. Nothing is sent for a period with no uploads. Choose Monthly (the default), Weekly, Daily, or Off under Settings -> Big File Uploads -> Email Summary.


### FTP/SFTP Client-free File Uploading

Upload files right to the WordPress media library without additional credentials and settings. Skip the protocol settings, server names, port numbers, usernames, long passwords, and private keys. Manage upload size and simplify your workflow for yourself or your clients.


### Widely Compatible

Other plugins simply rewrite the .htaccess or php.ini files in an attempt to adjust the server configuration which does not work with many hosts or causes timeouts. Big File Uploads changes how files are processed and uploads files in chunks (separate smaller pieces) before handing it off to WordPress making it universally compatible with most major hosting services.


### Wanna make your media library infinitely scalable? Move your big files and uploads directory to the cloud.

Big File Uploads is built to work with [Infinite Uploads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/infinite-uploads/) to make your site's upload directory infinitely scalable. A large WordPress media library can slow down your server and run up the cost of bandwidth and storage with your hosting provider. Move your uploads directory to the Infinite Uploads cloud to save on storage and bandwidth and improve site performance and security.

### Extend Big File Uploads to your forms!

[Big File Form Uploads](https://infiniteuploads.com/big-file-form-uploads/) is a paid add-on that  extends the functionality of increasing the maximum WordPress file upload size to your favorite form plugins for WordPress, including Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, and Forminator! Set the limit in Big File Uploads, and that carries over to your file uploads in your forms to let your users upload big files!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the biggest file size that can be uploaded? =

Uploads can be as large as available disk space for temporary files allows, or up to the maximum upload size limit you set in Settings -> Big File Uploads -> Uploading Files.

= Can I set a different upload limit for videos than for images? =

Yes. Turn on "Customize by file type" in Settings -> Big File Uploads and give images, audio, video, documents, and archives their own maximum size. Any type you leave blank uses the main limit, and the per-type limits can be set once for all users or separately for each user role.

= How do I change how often the email summary arrives, or turn it off? =

Go to Settings -> Big File Uploads and choose Monthly, Weekly, Daily, or Off under Email Summary, then save. Every summary email also includes a link to that setting. The summary is not available on multisite networks.

= Where does the email summary get its numbers? =

From your own site: the media library and the results of your last storage scan. The summary is created and sent by your site to its admin email address, and it never runs a scan of its own to build the email.

= Is Big File Uploads a free plugin? =

Yes all features of the Big File Uploads plugin are completely free and do not have a premium upgrade.

= Will Big File Uploads allow me to increase the upload limit for a form plugin (or other plugin) that allow users to upload on the frontend of my website? =

No. Frontend uploading built-in to plugins like Forminator, Gravity Forms, and WPForms do not use the same process as the WordPress media uploader on the backend of WordPress. Big File Uploads only works with the backend uploader or plugins that use the built-in media uploader code base to process the files.

= What media files can be uploaded? Are there any limitations with Big File Uploads? =

If you can upload it to the WordPress media library, Big File Uploads can process it. Big File Uploads can process everything from images and archive files to huge video and audio files.

= Is Infinite Uploads required for Big File Uploads to work? =

No. [Infinite Uploads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/infinite-uploads/) is an optional service to offload your media files to the cloud and make your WordPress website storage infinitely scalable. Perfect for sites that need to store many large file uploads.

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/wordpress/plugin/tuxedo-big-file-uploads/vdp)
